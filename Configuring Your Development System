Introduction to Configuring Your Development System
Now that we have learned how the Linux kernel is developed and taken a more in-depth look at the Linux kernel community, 
it is time to get down to the nuts and bolts. We will start configuring the development system. ​This chapter will walk you through getting your system ready for development. 
We will discuss finding a system, installing a Linux distribution, and installing the necessary tools.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Explain what makes a good development and test system.
Install a Linux distribution and understand how much space you need to allow in the boot partition for effective kernel development.
Discuss the tools necessary for kernel development.


Getting Your System Ready
Let's get started. The first order of business is finding a development system that best suits your needs. A regular laptop is a good choice for a basic development system, unless a specific architecture and/or configuration is needed.

The second step is to install the Linux distribution of your choice. There are several distributions to choose from:

Fedora
Debian releases - we recommend installing the current stable release, which you can pick from the Index of Releases
OpenSUSE
Ubuntu
This document will provide the details on configuring a kernel development system that runs a recent Ubuntu distribution. Please follow the Install Ubuntu desktop tutorial to install the Ubuntu release of your choice. Ubuntu tutorials are a good resource. Create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu and Create a bootable USB stick on Windows show you how to create a bootable USB stick, which you will need to do first, and then install Ubuntu desktop using it. You have a few other options, such as installing Ubuntu side-by-side with Windows or installing an Ubuntu virtual machine under a hypervisor, such as Oracle VirtualBox or VMware. We will not talk about how to install Ubuntu in this course. We leave you with the tips below on how much disk space to allocate.

On development and test systems, it is a good idea to ensure ample space for kernels in the boot partition. It is recommended that you choose a whole disk install or set aside 3 GB disk space for the boot partition.

Once the distribution is installed and the system is ready for development packages, enable the root account and sudo for your user account. The system might already have the build-essential package, which you need to build Linux kernels on an x86_64 system. Recent Ubuntu distributions install a lot of the tools we will need.

sudo apt-get install build-essential vim git cscope libncurses-dev libssl-dev bison flex

sudo apt-get install git-email

Once you have a development system, it is time to check if your system supports the Minimal requirements to compile the Kernel; these change from time to time. It is a good idea to make sure your system is configured correctly.

The next step is finding information on email clients and configuring your email client to send patches and respond to emails. We highly recommend using git send-email to send patches.

==================================================================================================================================
Configuring git-email to send patches is easy using the sendemail configuration option, once you have your smtp server configuration. There is a wealth of online resources for obtaining information on configuring git sendemail to send patches. You can see an example for Gmail below.
Gmail Example
Once you place the above configuration in your .gitconfig file, running git send-email mypatch.patch is all you have to do to send patches; mypatch.patch is generated by the git format-patch command.

Email Client Configuration
You still need to configure your email client to send responses, to review comments, and other communication with the community.

Things to Remember

Close Bottom post
Never top post in your response. Top posting is writing a message above the original text while responding to an email. Add your response at the bottom of the original text. Bottom posting makes reading and following review comments on a patch easier.

Close Inline post
When reviewing or responding to a patch, deleting or stripping parts of the message you are not replying to is a good practice, and makes it easier to follow the responses in the thread.

Close No HTML format
Disable compose messages in HTML format. Patches sent using HTML format will be automatically rejected by the development mailing lists.

Close No signatures
Do not include private information in your signature. This is important for privacy reasons, as you will be posting to mailing lists.

Close No attachments
Do not send patches as attachments.

In general, avoid attachments. Some exceptions are kernel logs or configuration files when reporting bugs.

You should refer to Email clients info for Linux for more details.

You must generate an app-specific password for authentication if you have 2-factor on your Gmail account. Please refer to the Examples in this document for more information.

Here is an example Thunderbird configuration screen that shows the above selections.
