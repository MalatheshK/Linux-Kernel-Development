Introduction to Building and Installing Your First Kernel
Next, we will walk you through building and installing a stable kernel on your newly configured development system.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Clone the stable kernel git repository.
Review the basics of generating configurations from old configurations on your system.
Build and install the kernel.

Cloning the Stable Kernel Git
Start by cloning the stable kernel git, building and installing the latest stable kernel. The stable cloning step below will create a new directory named linux-stable and populate it with the sources. The stable repository has several branches going back to linux-2.6.11.y. Let’s start with the latest stable release branch. As of this writing (April 2021), linux-5.12.y is used in the following example. You can find the latest stable or a recent active kernel release.

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux_stable
cd linux_stable
git branch -a | grep linux-5

    remotes/origin/linux-5.12.y
    remotes/origin/linux-5.11.y
    remotes/origin/linux-5.10.y

​git checkout linux-5.12.y

Copying the Configuration for Current Kernel from /boot
Starting with the distribution configuration file is the safest approach for the very first kernel install on any system. You can copy the configuration for your current kernel from /proc/config.gz or /boot. For example, we are running Ubuntu 19.04, and config-5.0.0-21-generic is the configuration we have in /boot on our system. Pick the latest configuration you have on your system and copy it to linux_stable/.config. In the following example, config-5.0.0-21-generic is the latest kernel configuration.

ls /boot
config-5.0.0-20-generic        memtest86+.bin
config-5.0.0-21-generic        memtest86+.elf
efi                            memtest86+_multiboot.bin
grub                           System.map-5.0.0-20-generic
initrd.img-5.0.0-20-generic    System.map-5.0.0-21-generic
initrd.img-5.0.0-21-generic    vmlinuz-5.0.0-20-generic
lost+found                     vmlinuz-5.0.0-21-generic

cp /boot/<config-5.0.0-21-generic> .config

Compiling the Kernel
Run the following command to generate a kernel configuration file based on the current configuration. This step is important to configure the kernel, which has a good chance to work correctly on your system. You will be prompted to tune the configuration to enable new features and drivers that have been added since Ubuntu snapshots the kernel from the mainline. make all will invoke make oldconfig in any case. We show these two steps separately to call out the configuration file generation step.

make oldconfig

Another way to trim down the kernel and tailor it to your system is by using make localmodconfig. This option creates a configuration file based on the list of modules currently loaded on your system.

lsmod > /tmp/my-lsmod
make LSMOD=/tmp/my-lsmod localmodconfig

Once this step is complete, it is time to compile the kernel. Using the -j option helps the compiles go faster. The -j option specifies the number of jobs (make commands) to run simultaneously:

make -j3 all



Installing the New Kernel
Once the kernel compilation is complete, install the new kernel:

su -c "make modules_install install"

The above command will install the new kernel and run update-grub to add the new kernel to the grub menu. It is time to reboot the system to boot the newly installed kernel. Before we do that, let's save logs from the current kernel to compare and look for regressions and new errors, if any. Using the -t option allows us to generate dmesg logs without the timestamps, and makes it easier to compare the old and the new.

dmesg -t > dmesg_current
dmesg -t -k > dmesg_kernel
dmesg -t -l emerg > dmesg_current_emerg
dmesg -t -l alert > dmesg_current_alert
dmesg -t -l crit > dmesg_current_crit
dmesg -t -l err > dmesg_current_err
dmesg -t -l warn > dmesg_current_warn
dmesg -t -l info > dmesg_current_info

In general, dmesg should be clean, with no emerg, alert, crit, and err level messages. If you see any of these, it might indicate some hardware and/or kernel problems.

If the dmesg_current is zero in length, secure boot is likely enabled on your system. When secure boot is enabled, you won’t be able to boot the newly installed kernel, as it is unsigned. You can disable secure boot temporarily on startup with the MOK manager. Your system should already have mokutil.

Let's first make sure secure boot is indeed enabled:

mokutil --sb-state

If you see the following, you are all set to boot your newly installed kernel:

SecureBoot disabled
Platform is in Setup Mode

If you see the following, disable secure boot temporarily on startup with MOK manager:

SecureBoot enabled
SecureBoot validation is disabled in shim

Disable validation:

sudo mokutil --disable-validation
root password
mok password: 12345678
mok password: 12345678
sudo reboot

The machine will reboot to a blue screen, the MOK manager menu. Type the number(s) shown on the screen: if it is 7, it is the 7th character of the password. So, keep 12345678. The question to answer is Yes to disable secure boot. Reboot.

You’ll see on startup after a new message (top left) saying <<Booting in insecure mode>>. The machine will boot normally after, and secure boot remains enabled. This change is permanent, a clean install won't overwrite it. You must keep it that way.

To re-enable it (please note that you won't be able to boot the kernels you build if you re-enable):

sudo mokutil --enable-validation
root password
mok password: 12345678
mok password: 12345678
sudo reboot

Booting the Kernel
Let’s take care of several important steps before trying out the newly installed kernel. There is no guarantee that the new kernel will boot. As a safeguard, we want to ensure that at least one good kernel is installed and that we can select it from the boot menu. By default, grub tries to boot the default kernel, which is the newly installed kernel. We change the default grub configuration file /etc/default/grub to the boot menu, and pause it so we can select the kernel to boot.

 

🚩
Please note that this option is specific to Ubuntu, and other distributions might have a different way of specifying boot menu options.
 

Increase the GRUB_TIMEOUT value to 10 seconds, so grub pauses in menu long enough to choose a kernel to boot:

Uncomment GRUB_TIMEOUT and set it to 10: GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
Comment out GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
If the newly installed kernel fails to boot, it is helpful to see the early messages to determine why.

 

Enable printing early boot messages to vga using the earlyprintk=vga kernel boot option:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="earlyprintk=vga"

 

Run update-grub to update the grub configuration in /boot:

sudo update-grub

 

Now, it’s time to restart the system. Once the new kernel comes up, compare the saved dmesg from the old kernel with the new one, and see if there are any regressions. If the newly installed kernel fails to boot, you must boot a good kernel and then investigate why the new kernel was unable to boot.​​

These steps are not specific to stable kernels. You can check out linux-mainline or linux-next and follow the same recipe of generating a new configuration from an oldconfig, build, and install the mainline or linux-next kernels.
